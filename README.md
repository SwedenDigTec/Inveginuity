Hi everyone! 

This is a new design of robot arm with exceptional low cost, high power and environmental resilience. 
It can be used for graffiti and wall art, so we will fund a robotics competition to advance them.

It has a super-simple design using RepRap wheels and timing belts.

Then the project aims for a machine that can does 5-8 simple garden jobs, 
because we believe that we live in the future and that pesticide is not necessary!

The tools are mathematically studied for very low complexity and cost:

Story:
Society today is based on black volcanoes which are transformed by advanced intelligence monkeys, into millions of plastic objects and chemicals. They fall out onto the world and dark volcano derivatives then flow into rivers and oceans, in PVC and polistyrene islands.
The monkeys have made humungous chimney machines that expel chemical volcano products into the atmosphere, and cars which burn refined volcano juice. Their brains are radio commanded by the overlords of the volcanos of darkness.
This project is about the concept of rainbow volcanos, Grainbolcanos, based on a rebel group of monkeys that design wind, sun, hydro and geo electron machines.
