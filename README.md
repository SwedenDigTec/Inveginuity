Hi everyone! 

This is a new design of robot arm with exceptional low cost, high power and environmental resilience. 
It can be used for graffiti and wall art, so we will fund a robotics competition to advance them.

It has a super-simple design using RepRap wheels and timing belts.

Then the project aims for a machine that can does 5-8 simple garden jobs, 
because we believe that we live in the future and that pesticide is not necessary!

The tools are mathematically studied for very low complexity and cost:

Have you seen a telescopic robot arm? Check the web, They're virtually non-existent. The designs are weird. The field is barely explored. The nearest commercial use is telescopic hydraulic crane booms with 3 to 45 ton hoisting limits.

Kevlar reinforced timing belts are favored for CNC, automatic gearboxes, cambelts, lawnmower drives, 3D printing, sawmills, photocopiers, articulated robots and 50 other common machines.

Letâ€™s be the first to fabricate telescopic power limbs with them. Trial and error can reveal a new technology for home projects, with major advantages over other kinds of robot arm. It is a difficult job with interesting new challenges.

Rainbow Volcano:

Society today is based on black volcanoes which are transformed by advanced intelligence monkeys, into millions of plastic objects and chemicals. They fall out onto the world and dark volcano derivatives then flow into rivers and oceans, in PVC and polistyrene islands.
The monkeys have made humungous chimney machines that expel chemical volcano products into the atmosphere, and cars which burn refined volcano juice. Their brains are radio commanded by the overlords of the volcanos of darkness.
This project is about the concept of rainbow volcanos, Grainbolcanos, based on a rebel group of monkeys that design wind, sun, hydro and geo electron machines.
