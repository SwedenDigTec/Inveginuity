It has a simple telescopic design using RepRap wheels and timing belts.

Anyone with a 3D printer will be able to print a robot arm with a reach of 60 to 80 cm for artwork. 

Story:
Society today is based on black volcanoes which are transformed by advanced intelligence monkeys, into millions of plastic objects and chemicals. They fall out onto the world and dark volcano derivatives then flow into rivers and oceans, in PVC and polistyrene islands.
The monkeys have made humungous chimney machines that expel chemical volcano products into the atmosphere, and cars which burn refined volcano juice. Their brains are radio commanded by the overlords of the volcanos of darkness.
This project is about the concept of rainbow volcanos, Grainbolcanos, based on a rebel group of monkeys that design wind, sun, hydro and geo electron machines.
